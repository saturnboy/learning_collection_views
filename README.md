Learning Collection Views
=========================

Here's a single Xcode project touching on some of the cool ways to use UICollectionViews in your iOS app.

Inside the project, there are a bunch of storyboards and their associated view controllers, each with an
example of different aspects of collection views.  There are also various how-to-extend exercises:

__Storyboard0__

* UITableView -- before collection views there were only tables

__Storyboard1__

* UICollectionView as a grid -- display data in a grid

__Storyboard2__

* UICollectionView as a paged scroll view -- display data in a one-cell-per-page horizontal scrollable paged view

__Storyboard3__

* UICollectionView with custom cell -- display data in a custom cell

__Storyboard4__

* UICollectionView as a row -- display data in a single scrolling horizontal row via a subview

__Storyboard5__

* UICollectionView inside a UICollectionViewCell -- display data in a grid inside a horizontal pager
