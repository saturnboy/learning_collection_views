Learning Collection Views
=========================

Here's a single Xcode project touching on some of the cool ways to use UICollectionViews in your iOS app.

Inside the project, there are a bunch of storyboards and their associated view controllers, each with an
example of different aspects of collection views.  There are also various how-to-extend exercises:

__Storyboard0__
* UITableView - before collection views there were only tables

__Storyboard1__
* UICollectionView as a grid - display data in a grid

__Storyboard2__
* UICollectionView as a row row - display data in a scrollable horizontal row

_all code is MIT_
